# Security Guideline Document

# Security Guidelines for Fitness Tracker Chatbot & Dashboard

This document defines the security requirements and best practices for the fitness tracker chatbot and dashboard. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that user data remains confidential, integrity is maintained, and the system is resilient against common threats.

---

## 1. Security by Design

- **Embed Security Early:** Incorporate threat modeling and security reviews at the design stage of every feature (chat ingestion, dashboard, AI plan generation).  
- **Least Privilege:** Grant each service and component only the permissions it absolutely needs:
  - Supabase service role only for migrations; client role for user data operations under RLS.  
  - Clerk has scoped API keys for authentication operations only.  
- **Defense in Depth:** Layer controls so that if one fails, others mitigate risk:
  - Network (HTTPS/TLS) + Application (Auth checks) + Database (RLS).  
- **Fail Securely:** Ensure errors do not leak stack traces or sensitive data—return generic messages in production.

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

### 2.1 Clerk Authentication

- Use Clerk.js for all sign-up, login, and session management.  
- Enforce strong password policies via Clerk settings (min length ≥ 8, complexity rules).  
- Enable idle and absolute session timeouts (e.g., 30 minutes idle, 24 hours max).  
- Protect against session fixation by regenerating session IDs on login.  
- Store session tokens in `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` cookies.  

### 2.2 Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS)

- Define RLS policies on all tables (`weights`, `workouts`, `meals`, `plans`) to restrict `user_id = auth.uid()`.  
- Test RLS via automated integration tests to verify cross-account data cannot leak.  

### 2.3 API Route Authorization

- Protect Next.js API routes with Clerk middleware.  
- Verify JWTs on each request; reject expired or invalid tokens.  
- Perform server-side role/permission checks for any future admin or coach roles.

## 3. Input Handling & Processing

### 3.1 Chat Input Validation

- Treat all chat messages as untrusted.  
- After ai-sdk extraction, validate each data point:
  - Weight/body fat: numeric ranges (e.g., 30–800 lbs, 1–100%).  
  - Workout sets/reps/weights: positive integers, reasonable upper bounds.  
  - Meal descriptions: length limits (e.g., ≤ 1,000 chars) and sanitize for HTML.  

### 3.2 Prevent Injection

- Use Supabase client (parameterized queries) rather than raw SQL strings.  
- Avoid string interpolation in database calls.  
- Sanitize any HTML stored or rendered in meal notes via a library like DOMPurify.  

### 3.3 Output Encoding

- Escape all user-supplied data before rendering in React components.  
- Leverage React’s default escaping for text nodes; avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.  

---

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

### 4.1 Encryption

- Enforce HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ on all endpoints (Vercel provides SSL certificates).  
- Ensure Supabase connections use TLS encryption.  
- Rely on PostgreSQL’s at-rest encryption (managed by Supabase).  

### 4.2 Secrets Management

- Store API keys and database URLs in environment variables (`.env.local`) and Vercel’s secret manager.  
- Never commit secrets to version control.  

### 4.3 Data Minimization & Retention

- Only collect data points necessary for core features.  
- Implement a user-driven account deletion flow that permanently purges all PII and fitness logs.  

### 4.4 Logging & Monitoring

- Mask or omit sensitive fields (email, tokens) in logs.  
- Monitor auth failures, RLS policy violations, and error rates.  

---

## 5. API & Service Security

### 5.1 HTTPS & CORS

- Serve all traffic over HTTPS; redirect HTTP → HTTPS.  
- CORS policy: allow only the production domain (e.g., `https://yourapp.com`).  

### 5.2 Rate Limiting & Throttling

- Implement basic rate limiting on `/api/chat` (e.g., max 10 messages/minute per user) to mitigate abuse.  

### 5.3 HTTP Methods & Versioning

- Use `POST` for chat data ingestion; `GET` for dashboard data retrieval.  
- Include API version in the route (e.g., `/api/v1/chat`) to support future changes.

## 6. Web Application Security Hygiene

### 6.1 Security Headers

Configure the following HTTP headers via Vercel or Next.js middleware:

- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:;`  
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`  
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`  
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`  
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade`  

### 6.2 CSRF Protection

- For state-changing requests (if any non-API form submissions exist), implement anti-CSRF tokens or rely on `SameSite=Strict` cookies for API calls.  

### 6.3 Dependency Integrity

- Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for any CDN-loaded scripts.  

---

## 7. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

- **Production vs. Development:** Disable Next.js debug mode and verbose error messages in production.  
- **Port & Service Exposure:** Only expose port 443; rely on Vercel’s managed infrastructure.  
- **OS & Framework Patching:** Keep Next.js, Node.js runtime, and all libraries up to date.  
- **File Permissions:** In container and serverless environments, ensure file permissions are locked to the minimum required.  

---

## 8. Dependency Management

- Maintain a `package-lock.json` for deterministic installs.  
- Run an SCA tool (e.g., Dependabot, npm audit) to catch vulnerabilities in `ai-sdk`, Next.js, Tailwind, and others.  
- Remove unused dependencies to shrink the attack surface.  

---

## 9. Incident Response & Review

- Define a security incident response plan: triage, containment, eradication, recovery.  
- Conduct periodic security reviews and automated scans (CI pipeline) to validate RLS policies and endpoint protections.  

---

By following these guidelines, the fitness tracker chatbot and dashboard will maintain robust defenses against common web threats, protect user privacy, and uphold a secure, reliable user experience.
